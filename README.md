# SCADA Intrusion Detection  

The repository accompanying the 2017 Fall semester project for DFSC 3316 Cryptography & Network Security.  

Utilizing network captures from the school's SCADA lab, run by Dr. Umit Karabiyik, we are developing a simple listen/alert program to determine SCADA system intrusions.

All code will be found here.
